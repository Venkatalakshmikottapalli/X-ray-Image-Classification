Canine cardiomegaly, characterized by heart enlargement,
presents significant diagnostic challenges in veterinary
medicine. This research introduces a Deep Convolutional
Neural Network (Deep CNN) architecture designed
for the automated detection of cardiomegaly in canine radiographs.
Unlike traditional methods that rely on pretrained
models such as VGG16 and EfficientNetB7, the proposed
Deep CNN offers a fully independent, end-to-end solution,
removing the need for transfer learning. Tailored
specifically for canine cardiac imaging, the architecture
demonstrates robust feature extraction capabilities. Experimental
results show that the approach achieves comparable
or superior accuracy to existing techniques while significantly
reducing computational complexity. This study
presents a streamlined yet highly effective model utilizing
Deep CNNs to efficiently process extracted features. Comparative
evaluations with VGG16 and EfficientNetB7 highlight
the improved performance and efficiency of the proposed
method. The findings underscore the potential of integrating
Deep CNN based architectures into veterinary diagnostics,
contributing to enhancing automated cardiac assessment
tools in clinical practice.
